    * update_demo_content: Select this skill if user wants to change all or some guides in the demo. Ideally you would choose this skill if the user's request might span more than one guide in the demo. For example, if user wants to change the language of the demo / tone of the demo / ask you to personalize demo then you'd know that the whole demo might be changed.

    * update_theme: Select this skill when user wants to change the visual property (theme / scheme) of guides in the demo.
    *
    * 'na': Select this skill in case you are not sure what user wants or if you don't find an relevant skill for user's intent.
